    "\n",
    "1. **DPD (Days Past Due):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** DPD refers to the number of days a borrower has exceeded the due date for a loan payment.\n",
    "   - **Example:** If a borrower's monthly loan payment is due on the 1st of each month and they miss the payment, they enter DPD status. For instance, if the current date is the 15th and the borrower hasn't made the payment, they are 15 days past due.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-performing Asset (NPA):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** A loan becomes an NPA if the borrower misses payments for a specific period, often 90 days or more.\n",
    "   - **Example:** If a borrower hasn't made any payments for 90 days on a loan, it is classified as an NPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Special Mention Account (SMA):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** SMA refers to loans identified by banks as having a high potential of turning into NPAs.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A loan with consistent delays in payments or signs of financial stress from the borrower may be categorized as SMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Write-off:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** A loan is written off when the bank deems it unrecoverable and removes it from active accounts.\n",
    "   - **Example:** If all attempts to recover a loan fail, such as through legal actions or negotiations, the bank may decide to write off the loan as a loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these stages helps banks manage risks associated with loans and take appropriate actions to recover funds or minimize losses."
